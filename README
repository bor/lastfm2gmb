lastfm2gmb
========================

Script to import (sync) playcount from last.fm to gmusicbrowser
lastplay, tags, rating - not realized yet, see TODO


DEPENDENCIES

perl >=5.8 (for utf8 correct use)
Getopt::Long
LWP::UserAgent
Net::DBus

gmusicbrowser (with Dbus implemented, tested on 1.0.1)


INSTALLATION

Just copy and run :)


USAGE

gmusicbrowser must be running and the music files must be in its library.

$ lastfm2gmb.pl [-q|-d debuglevel] [-k api_key] -u lastfm_username


KNOWN ISSUES

* Problem with duplicate track_title's in different albums - now it only skip this tracks
* Dbus sometimes failing to update values - so I recommend run script several times
